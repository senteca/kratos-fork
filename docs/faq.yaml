  q: We want to seperate our customers and employees, so we store them in different
    databases. But we would like to have them use the same login dialog for our portal.
    How can I achieve that with Ory Kratos?
  a: You can deploy Ory Kratos two times, and use the same login/registration endpoints
    if you like. You may need to tell you login/registration ui which Kratos it is
    supposed to talk to.

  q: What is the correct flow to sanitize the username and make sure it satisfies
    a specific regex (e.g. only alphanumeric characters)?
  a: 'In the identity json schema using https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#regular-expressions.
    To sanitize usernames coming from third-party OIDC providers like Google or GitHub
    you write jsonnet code: https://jsonnet.org.'

  q: Some of our identity traits fields may be the subject to identity validation
    (know your customer, KYC). Once they are validated we do not allow the identity
    to be edited by the end-user. Is there anything in the roadmap to support this
    scenario?
  a: 'There is an open issue for this feature: https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/47.'

  q: 'Are there plans to provide hooks on registration/login/logouts/identity updates? '
  a: 'Yes! Check these issues for more information on the current progress: https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/271
    and https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/30.'

  q: How can I verify beforehand if a username is available during registration?
  a: You can't right now. It would allow account enumeration attacks.

  - migration
  q: Do have plans to support user migration scenarios similar to auth0 automatic
    migrations? E.g. configure a callback to the legacy system when you cannot find
    the corresponding user, and store the identity on successful legacy system response.
  a: No plans yet, but migration is an important piece of the puzzle. We will probably
    focus on importing existing users first though. An alternative to callback and
    custom code is probably fronting the legacy system with ORY Hydra (OAuth2/OIDC
    Server) and then using that as an upstream in ORY Kratos.

  q: Do you have protection or plans for brute force attacks i.e. repetitive login
    attempts? Leaked database scans?
  a: 'See the following document: [Ory Kratos Security Measures](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/concepts/security#passwords)'

  q: How do I append a random suffix e.g. a number to OIDC usernames if the username
    returned by a provider is already taken.
  a: 'Not sure if jsonnet has a rand function built into the stdlib, but it does have
    the md5 function. You can probably use that. '

  q: I want to implement a single-page-app (SPA). Can i do that with kratos?
  a: Yes, definitely. We don't have an example-app, though. Also you might not come
    around some page-reloads as you definitely should avoid the API-flows and use
    the browser-flows instead. So hopefully you're not too strict with your SPA. [Issue](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/668)

  - traits
  q: I want read-only or hidden user-specific data. Can't i use traits for that?
  a: Traits are currently visible to the user and also editable by him. Although it
    make sense to have read-only and/or hidden traits for users, we can't give any
    timing when such features will be available. [Issue](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/47)
