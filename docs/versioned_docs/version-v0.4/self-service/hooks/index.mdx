title: Hooks
---

Hooks execute logic after a flow (login, registration, settings, ...):

- *After login:* is executed after a login was successful.
- *After registration:* is executed when a registration was successful:
  - *Before persisting:* runs before the identity is saved in the database.
  - *After persisting:* runs after the identity was saved in the database.
- *After settings:* is executed when a settings was successful:
  - *Before persisting:* runs before the identity is saved in the database.
  - *After persisting:* runs after the identity was saved in the database.

## Login

### After

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    login:
      after:
        password:
          - hook: revoke_active_sessions
```

#### `revoke_active_sessions`

The `revoke_active_sessions` will delete all active sessions for that user on
successful login:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    login:
      after:
        <strategy>:
          - hook: revoke_active_sessions
            # can not be configured
```

## Registration

Hooks running after successful user registration are defined per
Self-Service Registration Strategy in ORY Kratos' configuration file.

### After

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    registration:
      after:
        oidc:
          - hook: session
        password:
          - hook: session
```

#### `session`

Adding the `session` hook signs the user immediately in once the account has been created.
It runs after the identity has been saved to the database.

:::info

Using this job as part of your post-registration workflow makes your system
vulnerable to
[Account Enumeration Attacks](../../concepts/security.mdx#account-enumeration-attacks)
because a threat agent can distinguish between existing and non-existing
accounts by checking if `Set-Cookie` was sent as part of the registration
response.

:::

It sends  a `Set-Cookie` header which contains the session
cookie. To use it, you must first define one or more (for secret rotation)
secrets. You can either choose to use the "default" secrets or the more specific "cookie" secrets.
The other required config is setting the hook in `after` work flows:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos.config.yml"
secrets:
  cookie:
    - something-super-secret # The first entry will be used to sign and verify session cookies

    # All other entries will be used to verify session cookies that were signed before "something-super-secret" became
    # the current signing secret.
    - old-session-secret
    - older-session-secret
    - ancient-session-secret

selfservice:
  flows:
    registration:
      after:
        <strategy>:
          - hook: session
            # can not be configured
```

## Settings

Hooks running after successfully updating user settings and are defined per
Self-Service Settings Strategy in ORY Kratos' configuration file.

### After

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      after:
```

No hooks are available for this flow at the moment.
