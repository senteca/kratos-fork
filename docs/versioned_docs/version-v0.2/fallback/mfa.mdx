You ended up here because you did not set the following configuration value:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
urls:
  mfa_ui: http://my-app.com/mfa
```

You can set this configuration value using environment variable `URLS_MFA_UI` as
well!

If you don't know what that means, head over to our
[MFA Documentation](../self-service/flows/2fa-mfa-multi-factor-authentication.md)!
