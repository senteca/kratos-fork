id: login
title: This should be the Login UI

You ended up here because you did not set the following configuration value:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
urls:
  login_ui: http://my-app.com/login
```

You can set this configuration value using environment variable `URLS_LOGIN_UI`
as well!

If you don't know what that means, head over to
[User Login and Registration](../self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration.mdx)!
