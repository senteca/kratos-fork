In this document we will take a look at setting up "Sign in with GitHub" using
ORY Kratos.

Run the [Quickstart](../quickstart.mdx) with Docker Compose:

```shell script
# This assumes that you have ORY Kratos checked out locally and
# that your current directory ("pwd") is the folder where ORY Kratos
# is.

$ make quickstart
```

## GitHub

To set up "Sign in with GitHub" you must create a
[GitHub OAuth2 Client](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/).

Set the "Authorization callback URL" to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/browser/flows/strategies/oidc/callback/github
```

The pattern of this URL is:


```
http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>/self-service/browser/flows/strategies/oidc/callback/<provider-id>
```

The provider ID must point to the provider's ID set in the ORY Kratos
configuration file (explained in paragraphs).

:::note

GitHub does not implement OpenID Connect. Therefore, ORY Kratos makes a request
to
[GitHub's User API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-the-authenticated-user)
and adds that data to `std.extVar('claims')`. Check out what data is available
at
[GitHub's Scope Docs](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/).
Not all GitHub fields are supported however. Check the list of supported fields
[in the source code](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/v0.2.1-alpha.1/selfservice/strategy/oidc/provider_github.go#L72-L98).

:::

As explained in
[OpenID Connect and OAuth2 Credentails](../concepts/credentials/openid-connect-oidc-oauth2.mdx),
you must also create a Jsonnet code snippet for the provider. Save the code in
`<kratos-directory>/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/oidc.github.jsonnet`.
The following schema takes `email_primary` and maps it to `traits.email`:

```json title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/oidc.github.jsonnet"
local claims = {
  email_verified: false
} + std.extVar('claims');

{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
      // enumeration attacks, especially if the value is used for
      // e.g. verification or as a password login identifier.
      //
      // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
      // by GitHub.
      [if "email" in claims && claims.email_verified then "email" else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```

Now, enable the GitHub provider in the ORY Kratos config located at
`<kratos-directory>/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/.kratos.yml`.

```yaml title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/.kratos.yml"
# $ kratos -c path/to/my/kratos/config.yml serve
selfservice:
  strategies:
    oidc:
      enabled: true
      config:
        providers:
          - id: github # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
            provider: github
            client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID provided by GitHub
            client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client Secret provided by GitHub
            mapper_url: file:///etc/config/kratos/oidc.github.jsonnet
            scope:
              - user:email
```

Next, open the login endpoint of the SecureApp and you should see the GitHub
Login option!

## Google, LinkedIn, Facebook

Connecting with other Social Sign In providers will be very similar to the
GitHub flow. If you've managed to do it, write it down and make a PR against
this document! :)
