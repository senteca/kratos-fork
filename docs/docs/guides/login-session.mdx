A login session is created when a user signs in. The session is either stored as a cookie or as a token, depending
on the interaction type.

You can set the cookie's `max-age` value - which effectively sets how long the session is active - by changing
the ORY Kratos configuration file:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
session:
  lifespan: 720h # 30 days
```

Once the lifespan is reached, the user needs to sign in again. If `lifespan` is not set, then the cookie's `max-age`
will also not be set. Please be aware of how `max-age` behaves:

- The browser interprets the cookie to be removed when the session ends (e.g. the browser window is closed) if
`max-age` is not set as part of the `Set-Cookie` header. Please be aware that this behavior is not consistent across
browsers.
- The browser keeps the cookie until `max-age` is reached otherwise.
