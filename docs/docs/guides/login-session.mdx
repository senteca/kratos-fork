title: Login Sessions

A login session is created when a user signs in. The session is stored as a
cookie or as a token, depending on the interaction type. A session is valid for
the session lifespan you specify in the ORY Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
session:
  lifespan: 720h # 30 days
```

Per default the session cookie has the `max-age` parameter set to the specified
session lifespan. You may disable this behavior by setting:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
session:
  cookie:
    persistent: false
```

:::note

The cookie `max-age` parameter behaves as follows:

- The browser interprets the cookie to be removed when the session ends if
  `max-age` is not set as part of the `Set-Cookie` header. A session ends if the
  browser is terminated due to a reboot or when shutting down the browser.
- The browser keeps the cookie until `max-age` is reached otherwise.

:::

Once the lifespan is reached, the user needs to sign in again.
