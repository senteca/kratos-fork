title: Hosting own Have I Been Pwned API
---

Ory Kratos uses the Have I Been Pwned (HiBP) API, with the k-anonymity flag, to
check if the password the user registers with has been a part of one of the
breaches documented by the HiBP project.

In some environments, due to various CISO policies, it might be difficult to
establish egress connectivity to non-approved hosts. If it happens that your
Kratos operates in such an environment and it cannot communicate with the HiBP
API at haveibeenpwned.com, but there is the requirement to check if passwords
have been leaked, you can host the HiBP API yourself and configure Kratos to use
your own instance.

To do so, configure Kratos to use your API:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
selfservice:
  methods:
    password:
      config:
        haveibeenpwned_host: api.private.host
```

An example of a minimal self-hosted, k-anonymity enabled HiBP API
[can be found in this repository](https://github.com/radekg/hibp).

:::note

Ory Kratos `haveibeenpwned_host` setting does not allow configuring the
respective CA chain at the moment but it **does require a TLS connection**.
Therefore your private HiBP API must use one of the trusted CAs of the
underlying operating system.

A solution might be to host the HiBP API using a certificate issued by Let's
Encrypt certificate or install the private CA certificate in the trusted CA
certificates of the system on which Kratos is running.
