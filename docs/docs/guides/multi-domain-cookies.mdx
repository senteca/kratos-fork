title: Getting URLs and Cookies to Work on Multi-Domains

## Base URL

The public base URL (`serve.public.base_url`) is used to compute redirect URLs,
form action URLs, and more. If you host Ory Kratos on more than one domain you
might want to enable the domain aliasing feature. This allows to register
additional base URLs. On incoming HTTP Requests, Ory Kratos checks the HTTP
`Host` Header and compares that to the list of domain aliases. If a match is
found, that base url is used instead of `serve.public.base_url`:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
serve:
  public:
    base_url: https://this-is-the-default/base-url
    domain_aliases:
      - match_domain: www.another-domain.com
        base_url: https://www.another-domain.com/another-path
      - match_domain: that-domain.com
        base_url: https://that-domain.com/another-path
```

## Cookies

ORY Kratos' browser features rely heavily on HTTP Cookies to mitigate common
attack vectors and make the integration as easy as possible to use. Therefore it
is important to know that

1. [HTTP Cookies ignore ports](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1612177/are-http-cookies-port-specific),
meaning the browser will send a cookie it received for
`http://my-domain.com:1234` to `http://my-domain.com:4321` as well.
2. [Subdomains can set HTTP Cookies for parent domains](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18492576/share-cookie-between-subdomain-and-domain),
meaning a HTTP Cookie specifying `domain=my-domain.com` will be allowed to
   set even if the URL is `http://sub.my-domain.com` or
   `http://sub.sub.my-domain.com`.

You can adjust the session cookie's domain using:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
session:
  cookie:
    domain: my-domain.com
```

What **is not** currently possible is to set up ORY Kratos in a way where you
get session cookies running on two separate top level domains (e.g.
`my-domain.com` and `another-domain.com`). This is tracked as
[kratos#662](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/662).
