ORY Kratos allows users to update their own settings and profile information
using two principal flows:

- Browser-based (easy): This flow works for all applications running on top of a
  browser. Websites, single-page apps, Cordova/Ionic, and so on.
- API-based (advanced): This flow works for native applications like iOS
  (Swift), Android (Java), Microsoft (.NET), React Native, Electron, and others.

The flow described here is implemented by the
[profile](user-settings/user-profile-management.mdx),
[password](user-login-user-registration/username-email-password.mdx), and
[oidc](user-login-user-registration/openid-connect-social-sign-in-oauth2.mdx)
strategy.

## Self-Service User Settings for Browser Applications

ORY Kratos supports browser applications that run on server-side (e.g. Java,
NodeJS, PHP) as well as client-side (e.g. JQuery, ReactJS, AngularJS, ...).

Browser-based user settings management makes use of three core HTTP
technologies:

- HTTP Redirects
- HTTP POST (`application/json`, `application/x-www-urlencoded`) and RESTful GET
  requests.
- HTTP Cookies to prevent CSRF and Session Hijaking attack vectors.

The browser flow is the easiest and most secure to set up and integrated with.
ORY Kratos takes care of all required session and CSRF cookies and ensures that
all security requirements are fulfilled.

This flow is not suitable for scenarios where you use purely programmatic
clients that do not work well with HTTP Cookies and HTTP Redirects.

### The Settings User Interface

The Settings User Interface is a route (page / site) in your application that
renders the user settings / profile management User Interface / HTML Form:

```html
<!-- Profile management -->
<form action="..." method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="cdef..." />
  <input type="string" name="first_name" />
  <input type="string" name="last_name" />
  <input type="string" name="address" />
  <input type="..." name="..." />
  <input type="submit" />
</form>

<!-- Password management -->
<form action="..." method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="cdef..." />
  <input
    type="password"
    name="password"
    placeholder="Enter your new password here"
  />
</form>

<!-- Social Sign in  management -->
<form action="..." method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="cdef..." />
  <!-- ... -->
</form>
```

Reference these UI endpoints your ORY Kratos config file:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      ui_url: https://.../settings
```

In stark contrast to other Identity Systems, ORY Kratos does not render this
HTML. Instead, you need to implement the HTML code in your application (e.g.
NodeJS + ExpressJS, Java, PHP, ReactJS, ...), which gives you extreme
flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows and designs.

Each Settings Strategy ([Profile](user-settings/user-profile-management.mdx),
[Username and Password](user-login-user-registration/username-email-password.mdx),
[Social Sign In](user-login-user-registration/openid-connect-social-sign-in-oauth2.mdx),
Passwordless, ...) works a bit different but they all boil down to the same
abstract sequence:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
sequenceDiagram
  participant B as Browser
  participant K as ORY Kratos
  participant A as Your Application
  B->>K: Initialize Settings Flow
  K->>B: Redirects to your Application's /settings_ui endpoint
  B->>A: Calls /settings_ui
  A-->>K: Fetches data to render forms etc
  B-->>A: Fills out forms, clicks e.g. "Save Changes"
  B->>K: POSTs data to
  K-->>K: Processes Settings Info
  alt Settings data valid
    K-->>B: Updates Identity Settings
    K->>B: Redirects to e.g. Dashboard
  else Setings data invalid
    K-->>B: Redirects to your Applicaiton's /settings_ui endpoint
    B->>A: Calls /settings_ui
    A-->>K: Fetches data to render form fields and errors
    B-->>A: Fills out forms again, corrects errors
    B->>K: POSTs data again - and so on...
  end
`}
/>

### Code

The code example used here is universal and does not use an SDK because we want
you to understand the fundamentals of how this flow works.

While this example assumes a Server-Side Application, a Client-Side (e.g.
ReactJS) Application would work the same, but use ORY Kratos' Public API
instead.

#### Server-side route

You will notice that this endpoint is very similar to the one documented for
[User Login and Registration](user-login-user-registration.mdx).

```js
// Uses the ORY Kratos NodeJS SDK - for more SDKs check:
//
//  https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/sdk/index
const { CommonApi } = require('@oryd/kratos-client')

// The browser config key is used to redirect the user. It reflects where ORY Kratos' Public API
// is accessible from. Here, we're assuming traffic going to `http://example.org/.ory/kratos/public/`
// will be forwarded to ORY Kratos' Public API.
const kratosBrowserUrl = 'http://example.org/.ory/kratos/public/'

// Initializes the SDK with ORY Kratos' Admin API.
const commonApi = new CommonApi('https://ory-kratos-admin.example-org.vpc/')

// This route would be used like:
//
//    app.get('/user/settings', settingsHandler)
//
export const settingsHandler = (req, res, next) => {
  // The request ID is used to identify User Settings Request and
  // return data like the csrf_token and so on.
  const request = req.query.request
  if (!request) {
    console.log('No request found in URL, initializing flow.')
    res.redirect(`${kratosBrowserUrl}/self-service/browser/flows/settings`)
    return
  }

  commonApi
    .getSelfServiceBrowserSettingsRequest(request)
    .then(({ body, response }) => {
      if (response.statusCode !== 200) {
        res.redirect(`${kratosBrowserUrl}/self-service/browser/flows/settings`)
        return
      }

      // "body" contains all the request data for this User Settings Request.
      // You can process that data here, if you want.

      // Lastly, you probably want to render the data using a view (e.g. Jade Template):
      res.render('settings', body)
    })
  // Handle errors using ExpressJS' next functionality:
  //
  //    .catch(next)
}
```

#### Views

Implementing the view is simple as ORY Kratos provides you with all the
information you need for rendering the forms. The following example illustrates
a generic form generator (we use handlebars here) that works with ORY Kratos:

```handlebars name="views/partials/form.hbs"
<form action="{{form.action}}" method="{{form.method}}">
    {{~#each form.errors~}}
        <!-- global form validation errors -->
        <div class="error">{{message}}</div>
    {{~/each~}}

    {{#each form.fields}}
        {{~#each errors~}}
            <!-- validation errors for this specific field -->
            <div class="error">{{message}}</div>
        {{~/each~}}
        <input name="{{name}}" type="{{type}}" value="{{value}}" {{#if disabled}}disabled{{/if}}>
    {{/each}}

    <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```

In your main "Settings" view you would then consume this template for all the
methods you want to support:

```handlebars name="views/settings.hbs"
<!-- Make profile changes form: -->
{{#if methods.profile.config}}
    {{> form form=methods.profile.config}}
{{/if}}

<!-- Change passowrd form: -->
{{#if methods.password.config}}
    {{> form form=methods.password.config}}
{{/if}}

<!-- ... form: -->
<!-- ... -->
```

For details on payloads and potential HTML snippets consult the individual
Self-Service Strategies for:

- [Username and Password Strategy](user-login-user-registration/username-email-password.mdx)
- [Social Sign In Strategy](user-login-user-registration/openid-connect-social-sign-in-oauth2.mdx)
- [Profile](user-settings/user-profile-management.mdx)

### Server-Side Browser Applications

Let's take a look at the concrete network topologies, calls, and payloads. Here,
we're assuming that you're running a server-side browser application (written in
e.g. PHP, Java, NodeJS) to render the settings screen on the server and make all
API calls from that server code. The counterpart to this would be a client-side
browser application (written in e.g. Vanilla JavaScript, JQuery, ReactJS,
AngularJS, ...) that uses AJAX requests to fetch data. For these type of
applications, read this section first and go to section
[Client-Side Browser Applications](#client-side-browser-applications) next.

#### Network Architecture

We recommend checking out the
[Quickstart Network Architecture](../../quickstart.mdx#network-architecture) for
a high-level, exemplary, overview of the network. In summary:

1. The SecureApp (your application) is exposed at http://127.0.0.1:4455 and
   proxies requests matching path `./ory/kratos/public/*` to ORY Krato's Public
   API Port.
1. ORY Kratos exposes (for debugging only!!) the Public API at
   http://127.0.0.1:4433 and Admin API at http://127.0.0.1:4434.
1. Within the "intranet" or "private network", ORY Kratos is exposed at
   http://kratos:4433 and http://kratos:4434. These URLs are be used by the
   SecureApp to communicate with ORY Kratos.

Keep in mind that his architecture is just one of many possible network
architectures. It is however one of the simplest as well and it works locally.
For production deployments you would probably use an Reverse Proxy such as
Nginx, Kong, Envoy, ORY Oathkeeper, or others.

#### User Settings Process Sequence

The User Settings Flow is composed of several high-level steps summarized in
this state diagram:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram
  s1: User browses app
  s3: User ends up at settings_ui which renders the User Settings Form
  s4: Execute "After Settings Hook(s)"
  s5: Update "Settings Request" with Error Context(s)
  s6: Settings update successful
	[*] --> s1
  s1 --> s3 : User clicks "Manage Account" and is redirected to Settings Init Endpoint
  s3 --> s4 : User provides valid profile data
  s3 --> s5 : User provides invalid profile data
  s5 --> s3 : User is redirected to Settings UI URL
  s4 --> Error : A Hook fails
  s4 --> s6
  s6 --> [*]
  Error --> [*]
`}
/>

1. The flow is initiated by directing the user's browser to
   `http://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/browser/flows/settings`.
1. ORY Kratos does some internal processing (e.g. checks if a session cookie is
   set, generates payloads for form fields, sets CSRF token, ...) and redirects
   the user's browser to the Settings UI URL which is defined using the
   `selfservice.flows.settings.ui_url` config or
   `SELFSERVICE_FLOWS_SETTINGS_UI_URL` environment variable, which is set to the
   ui endpoints - for example `https://127.0.0.1:4455/settings`. The user's
   browser is thus redirected to
   `https://127.0.0.1:4455/settings?request=abcde`. The `request` query
   parameter includes a unique ID which will be used to fetch contextual data
   for this settings request.
1. Your Server-Side Application makes a `GET` request to
   `http://kratos:4434/self-service/browser/flows/requests/settings?request=abcde`.
   ORY Kratos responds with a JSON Payload that contains data (form fields,
   error messages, ...) for all enabled User Profile Strategies:
   ```json5
   {
     id: 'abcde',
     request_url: '...',
     methods: {
       profile: { method: 'profile', config: { action: '...', fields: [] } },
       password: { method: 'password', config: { action: '...', fields: [] } },
       oidc: { method: 'oidc', config: { action: '...', fields: [] } }
     }
   }
   ```
1. Your Server-Side applications renders the data however you see fit. The User
   interacts with it and completes the flow by e.g. updating the password or
   some other profile data.
1. The User's browser makes a request to one of ORY Kratos' Strategy URLs (e.g.
   `http://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/browser/flows/settings/strategies/profile?request=abcde`
   or `/self-service/browser/flows/settings/strategies/password?request=abcde`).
   ORY Kratos validates the data:
   - If the form data is invalid, the Settings Request's JSON Payload is
     updated - for example with
     ```json5
     {
       id: 'abcde',
       methods: {
         oidc: {
           method: 'oidc',
           config: {
             /* ... */
           }
         },
         password: {
           method: 'password',
           config: {
             /* ... */
             messages: [
               {
                 id: 4000006,
                 text: 'The provided credentials are invalid. Check for spelling mistakes in your password or username, email address, or phone number.',
                 type: 'error'
               }
             ]
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```
     and the user's Browser is redirected back to the Settings UI:
     `https://127.0.0.1:4455/settings_ui?request=abcde`.
   - If the data is valid but the modifications require proof of identity (e.g.
     because the primary email address or the password was changed), a settings
     flow is executed. Only after a successful settings flow will the changed
     data be stored!
   - If data is valid, ORY Kratos proceeds with the next step.
1. ORY Kratos executes hooks defined in the **After Settings Hooks**. If a
   failure occurs, the whole flow is aborted.
1. The client receives the expected response. For browsers, this is a HTTP
   Redirection, for API clients it will be a JSON response containing the
   session and/or identity. For more information on this topic check
   [Self-Service Flow Completion](../../concepts/browser-redirect-flow-completion.mdx).

  end
`}
/>

### Client-Side Browser Applications

Because Client-Side Browser Applications do not have access to ORY Kratos' Admin
API, they must use the ORY Kratos Public API instead. The flow for a Client-Side
Browser Application is almost the exact same as the one for Server-Side
Applications, with the small difference that
`https://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/browser/flows/requests/settings?request=abcde`
would be called via AJAX instead of making a request to
`https://kratos:4434/self-service/browser/flows/requests/settings?request=abcde`.

To prevent brute force, guessing, session injection, and other attacks, it is
required that cookies are working for this endpoint. The cookie set in the
initial HTTP request made to
`https://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/browser/settings` MUST
be set and available when calling this endpoint!

:::info

The initialization request
(`http://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/browser/flows/settings`)
**cannot** be made via AJAX or API requests. You **must** open that URL in the
user's browser using e.g. `window.open` `location.href` or plain and simple old
`<a href=...>`.

:::

#### User Settings Request State

The Settings Request contains a state with two possible values:

- `show_form`: No user data has been collected, or it is invalid, and thus the
  form should be shown.
- `successful`: Indicates that the settings request has been updated
  successfully with the provided data. The state will stay `successful` when
  repeatedly checking. If the form is still displayed and the user adds more
  data, the state will revert back to `show_form` on validation errors.

<Mermaid
  chart={`stateDiagram-v2
[*] --> show_form
show_form --> show_form: Validation fails
show_form --> success: Identity was updated
success --> show_form: Validation fails
success --> [*]
`}
/>

## Self-Service User Settings for API Clients

Will be addressed in a future release.

## Hooks

ORY Kratos allows you to configure hooks that run before and after a profile
update was successful. For more information about hooks please read the
[Hook Documentation](../hooks/index).
