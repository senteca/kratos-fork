ORY Kratos implements flows that users perform themselves as opposed to
administrative intervention. Facebook and Google both provide self-service
registration and profile management features as you are able to make changes to
your profile and sign up yourself.

Most believe that user management systems are easy to implement because picking
the right password hashing algorithm and sending an account verification code is
a solvable challenge. The real complexity however hides in the details and
attack vectors of self-service flows. Most data leaks happen because someone is
able to exploit

- registration: with attack vectors such as account enumeration (), ...;
- login: phishing, account enumeration, leaked password databases, brute-force,
  ...;
- user settings: account enumeration, account takeover, ...;
- account recovery: social engineering attacks, account takeover, spoofing, and
  so on.

There are also many other areas you need to think about, such as:

- Mobile, Smart TV, ... authentication
- Linking and unlinking social profiles (e.g. "Sign in with Google" or "Connect
  with Google") to existing accounts

ORY Kratos applies best practices established by experts (National Institute of
Sciences NIST, Internet Engineering Task Force IETF, Microsoft Research, Google
Research, Troy Hunt, ...) and implements the following flows:

- [Login and Registration](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration)
- [Logout](self-service/flows/user-logout)
- [User Settings](self-service/flows/user-settings)
- [Account Recovery](self-service/flows/account-recovery)
- [Address Verification](self-service/flows/verify-email-account-activation)
- [User-Facing Error](self-service/flows/user-facing-errors)
- [2FA / MFA](self-service/flows/2fa-mfa-multi-factor-authentication)

Some flows break down into "flow methods" which implement some of the flow's
business logic:

- The `password` strategy implement the
  [login and registration with "email or/and username and password" method](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration/username-email-password),
  and
  ["change your password" user settings method](self-service/flows/user-settings/change-password).
- The `oidc` (OpenID Connect, OAuth2, Social Sign In) strategy implements
  ["Sign in with ..." login and registration method](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration/openid-connect-social-sign-in-oauth2)
  and
  ["un/link another social account" user settings method](self-service/flows/user-settings/link-unlink-openid-connect-oauth2).
- The `profile` strategy implements the
  ["update your profile", "change your first/last name, ..." user settings method)](self-service/flows/user-settings/user-profile-management).
- The `link` strategy implements the
  ["click this link to reset your password" account recovery method](self-service/flows/user-settings/user-profile-management).

Some flows additionally implement the ability
[to run hooks](self-service/hooks/index) which allow users to be immediately
signed in after registration, notify another system on successful registration
(e.g. Mailchimp), and so on.

## Performing Login, Registration, Settings, ... Flows

There are two flow types supported in ORY Kratos:

- Flows where the user sits in front of the Browser (e.g. website, single page
  app, ...)
- Flows where API interaction is required (e.g. mobile app, Smart TV, ...)

All Self-Service Flows
([User Login](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration),
[User Registration](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration),
[Profile Management](self-service/flows/user-settings),
[Account Recovery](self-service/flows/account-recovery),
[Email or Phone verification](self-service/flows/verify-email-account-activation))
support these two flow types and use the same data models but do use different API endpoints.

:::warning

**Never use API flows to implement Browser applications!**

Using API flows in Single-Page-Apps as well as server-side apps opens up several potential attack vectors, including
including Login and other CSRF attacks.

:::

## Browser Flows

The browser flow has three stages:

- Initialization and redirect to UI;
- Form rendering;
- Form submission and payload validation.

The high-level sequence diagram for browser flows looks as follows:

<Mermaid
  chart={`sequenceDiagram
  participant B as Browser
  participant K as ORY Kratos
  participant A as Flow UI
  B->>K: Follow link to /self-service/<login|settings|registration|...>/browser
  K-->>K: Create and store new login flow
  K->>B: HTTP 302 Found <selfservice.flows.<login|...>.ui_url>?flow=<flow-id>
  B->>A: Opens <selfservice.flows.<login|...>.ui_url>?flow=<flow-id>
  A-->>K: Fetches data to render forms using /selfservice/<login|...>/flows?id=<flow-id>
  B-->>A: Fills out forms, clicks e.g. "Log in", "Sign Up", "Update Email", ...
  B->>K: Submits form
  K-->>K: Validates and processes form payloads
  alt Form payload is valid valid
    K->>B: Perform flow-specific action (e.g. create user, set session cookie, ...)
  else Login data invalid
    K-->>K: Update and store flow (e.g. add form validation errors)
    K-->>B: HTTP 302 Found <selfservice.flows.<login|...>.ui_url>?flow=<flow-id>
    B->>A: Opens <selfservice.flows.<login|...>.ui_url>?flow=<flow-id>
    A-->>K: Fetches data to render form fields and errors
    B->>K: Repeat flow with input data, submit, validate, ...
  end`}
/>

### Initialization and Redirect to UI

First, the Browser opens the flow's initialization endpoint (e.g.`/self-service/login/browser`,
`/self-service/registration/browser`, ...):

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  values={[
    {label: 'CURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'HTML', value: 'html'},
    {label: 'Javascript', value: 'js'},
    {label: 'ExpressJS', value: 'nodejs'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

This curl -s request emulates a browser request:

```
$ curl -s -v -X GET \
  -H "Accept: text/html" \
  http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser

# Request Headers
> GET /self-service/login/browser HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:4433
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: text/html
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="html">

```html
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser">Sign in</a>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js">

```html
<script>
const initLogin = () => {
  window.location.href = 'http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser'
}
</script>

<a onClick="initLogin">Sign in</a>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```js
express.get('/login', function (req, res) {
  res.redirect(302, 'http://127.0.0.1:4433/')
})

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The initialization endpoint creates a flow object and stores it in the
database. The flow object has an ID and contains additional information about
the flow such as the login methods (e.g. "username/password" and "Sign in
with Google") and their form data.

Once stored, the Browser is HTTP 302 redirected to the flow's configured UI URL (e.g.
`selfservice.flows.login.ui_url`), appending the flow ID as the `flow` URL
Query Parameter. The initialization endpoint (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser`)
responsds with:

```
$ curl -s -v -X GET \
  -H "Accept: text/html" \
  http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser

# Response Headers
< HTTP/1.1 302 Found
< Cache-Control: 0
< Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
< Location: http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/login?flow=dd5be6df-a293-4749-aab6-209348829e09
< Set-Cookie: csrf_token=qhMCbVX6iDyw1x/701zlINVFFqfkZrq1t/Z27Z1uFDw=; Path=/.ory/kratos/public/; Domain=127.0.0.1; Max-Age=31536000; HttpOnly
< Vary: Cookie
< Date: Mon, 17 Aug 2020 13:54:52 GMT
< Content-Length: 97
```

### Form Rendering

The Browser opens the URL which renders the HTML form that, for example, shows the "username and password" field,
the "Update your email address" field, or other flow forms. This HTML form is rendered be the [Self-Service UI](concepts/ui-user-interface#self-service-user-interface-ssui)
which you fully control.

The endpoint responsible for the UI URL uses the `flow` URL Query Parameter
(e.g. `http://my-app/auth/login?flow=abcde`) to call the flow information
endpoint (e.g. `/self-service/login/flows?id=abcde`) and fetch the flow
data - so for example the login form and any validation errors. This endpoint
is available at both ORY Kratos's Public and Admin Endpoints. For example,
the Self-Service UI responsible for rendering the Login HTML Form would
make a request along the lines of:

```
# The endpoint uses ORY Kratos' REST API to fetch information about the request
$ curl -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/flows?id=dd5be6df-a293-4749-aab6-209348829e09" | jq
```

The result includes login methods, their fields, and additional information about the flow:

```json
{
  "id": "dd5be6df-a293-4749-aab6-209348829e09",
  "type": "browser",
  "expires_at": "2020-08-17T14:04:52.2276396Z",
  "issued_at": "2020-08-17T13:54:52.2276396Z",
  "request_url": "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser",
  "messages": null,
  "methods": {
    "password": {
      "method": "password",
      "config": {
        "action": "http://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/login/methods/password?flow=dd5be6df-a293-4749-aab6-209348829e09",
        "method": "POST",
        "fields": [
          {
            "name": "identifier",
            "type": "text",
            "required": true,
            "value": ""
          },
          {
            "name": "password",
            "type": "password",
            "required": true
          },
          {
            "name": "csrf_token",
            "type": "hidden",
            "required": true,
            "value": "pW6qLAS39HaXruAooEa7phFCKXoFWUkzIGe4FK+BlmcPfahBUU18Sid5/9NzGl6GxAc/3eE/84aXkc75Mu+CWw=="
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "forced": false
}
```

For more details, check out the individual flow documentation. The flow UI then renders the given methods. For
the example above, a suitable HTML Form would look along the lines of:

```html
<form action="http://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/login/methods/password?flow=dd5be6df-a293-4749-aab6-209348829e09">
    <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="pW6qLAS39HaXruAooEa7phFCKXoFWUkzIGe4FK" />
    <input type="text" name="identifier" placeholder="Enter your username or email address" />
    <input type="password" name="password" />
    <input type="submit" value="Log in" />
</form>
```

### Form Submission and Payload Validation

The user completes the flow by submitting the form. The form action always points to ORY Kratos directly.
The business logic for the flow method will then validate the form payload and return to the UI URL on
validation errors. The UI then fetches the information about the flow again

```
# The endpoint uses ORY Kratos' REST API to fetch information about the request
$ curl -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/flows?id=dd5be6df-a293-4749-aab6-209348829e09" | jq
```

which now includes validation errors and other potential messages:

```json
{
  "id": "dd5be6df-a293-4749-aab6-209348829e09",
  "type": "browser",
  "expires_at": "2020-08-17T14:04:52.2276396Z",
  "issued_at": "2020-08-17T13:54:52.2276396Z",
  "request_url": "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser",
  "messages": null,
  "methods": {
    "password": {
      "method": "password",
      "config": {
        "action": "http://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/login/methods/password?flow=dd5be6df-a293-4749-aab6-209348829e09",
        "method": "POST",
        "fields": [
          /* ... */
          {
            name: 'password',
            type: 'text',
            value: '',
            messages: [
              {
                /* id, type, ... */
                text: "password: Value can not be empty"
              }
            ]
          }
          /* ... */
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "forced": false
}
```

If a system error (e.g. broken configuration file) occurs, the browser is redirected to the
[Error UI](self-service/flows/user-facing-errors).

If the form payload is valid, the flow completes with a success. The result here depends on the flow itself -
the login flow for example redirects the user to a specified redirect URL and sets a session cookie. The
registration flow also redirects to a specified redirect URL but only creates the user in the database and might
issue a session cookie if configured to do so.

## API Flows

:::warning

**Never use API flows to implement Browser applications!**

Using API flows in Single-Page-Apps as well as server-side apps opens up several potential attack vectors, including
including Login and other CSRF attacks.

:::

API flows have three stages:

- Initialization **without redirect**
- Form rendering using e.g. native iOS, Android, ... components
- Form submission as `application/json` and payload validation

The high-level sequence diagram for API flows looks as follows:

<Mermaid
  chart={`sequenceDiagram
  participant B as API Client
  participant K as ORY Kratos
  B->>K: REST GET /self-service/<login|settings|registration|...>/api
  K-->>K: Create and store new login flow
  K->>B: HTTP 200 OK with flow as application/json payload
  B-->>B: Render form using e.g. Native iOS UI Elements
  B-->>B: User fills out forms, clicks e.g. "Log in", "Sign Up", "Update Email", ...
  B->>K: REST POST to e.g. /self-service/login/methods/password
  K-->>K: Validates and processes payload
  alt Form payload is valid valid
    K->>B: Perform flow-specific action (e.g. create user, return session cookie, ...)
  else Login data invalid
    K-->>K: Update and store flow (e.g. add form validation errors)
    K->>B: Respond with e.g. HTTP 400 Bad Request and updated flow as payload
    B-->>B: Render form and validation errors using e.g. Native iOS UI Elements
    B-->>K: Repeat flow with input data, submit, validate, ...
  end`}
/>

### Initialization

The client (e.g. mobile application) makes a request to the flow's initialization endpoint (e.g.`/self-service/login/api`,
`/self-service/registration/api`, ...):

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  values={[
    {label: 'curl', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'NodeJS', value: 'nodejs'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```
$ curl -s -X GET \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/api | jq

{
  "id": "57374fa5-336a-4381-b471-92d7de939859",
  "type": "api",
  "expires_at": "2020-08-17T14:10:34.9952023Z",
  "issued_at": "2020-08-17T14:00:34.9952023Z",
  "request_url": "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/api",
  "messages": null,
  "methods": {
    "password": {
      "method": "password",
      "config": {
        "action": "http://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/login/methods/password?flow=57374fa5-336a-4381-b471-92d7de939859",
        "method": "POST",
        "fields": [
          {
            "name": "identifier",
            "type": "text",
            "required": true,
            "value": ""
          },
          {
            "name": "password",
            "type": "password",
            "required": true
          },
          {
            "name": "csrf_token",
            "type": "hidden",
            "required": true,
            "value": "YAgEhbVEWRHV4F+B0gGyIdUgusvZRCHyjBUhvbIgRuyRh2DdFRE90FLcQYy5LwEE245Aml0L+OF4qqPjZismiQ=="
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "forced": false
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch')

fetch.get('http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/api', {
  headers: { Accept: 'text/html' }
})
  .then(res=>res.json())
  .then((flow) => console.log(flow))
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The initialization endpoint creates a flow object and stores it in the
database. The flow object has an ID and contains additional information about
the flow such as the login methods (e.g. "username/password" and "Sign in
with Google") and their form data.

### Form Rendering

While the Browser flow redirects the client and uses cookies to protect against CSRF and session hijacking
attacks, the API flow answers with a fresh flow formatted as `application/json` right away. The client
would then use that information to render the UI. In React Native, this may look like the following
snippet:

```jsx
// import React from ...
import { PublicApi } from "@oryd/kratos-client"

const kratos = new PublicApi('http://127.0.0.1:4433')

const Login = () => {
  const [config, setConfig] = useState<LoginRequest | undefined>(undefined)

  useEffect(() => {
    kratos.initializeSelfServiceAPILoginFlow().then(({body: flow}) => {
      setConfig(flow.methods.password.config)
    })
  }, [])

  // This is a non-functional, code example. It is missing state management and so on.
  // The idea is to show how initializing such a flow would look like in an API scenario.
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Login</Text>

      <TextInput
        value={/*...*/}
        onChangeText={/*...*/}
        placeholder="Email or username"/>

      <TextInput
        value={/*...*/}
        onChangeText={/*...*/}
        secureTextEntry={true}
        autoCompleteType="password"
        textContentType="password"
        placeholder="Email or username"/>

      <Button
        title={"Log in"}
        onPress={/* ... */}
      />
    </View>
  )
}
```

If needed, the client can re-request the flow using the same HTTP Request as the browser flow:

```shell script
curl -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/flows?id=57374fa5-336a-4381-b471-92d7de939859" | jq

  {
    "id": "57374fa5-336a-4381-b471-92d7de939859",
    "type": "api",
  # ...
```

### Form Submission and Payload Validation

The request is then completed by sending the form formatted as `application/json` to the action endpoint

```shell script
flow=$(curl -s -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/api")
actionUrl=$(echo $flow | jq -r '.methods.password.config.action')

echo $actionUrl
# http://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/login/methods/password?flow=d6e0dd24-f5c6-4926-a526-616a9afeed9d

curl -s -X POST -H  "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"identifier": "i-do-not-exist@user.org", "password": "the-wrong-password"}' \
    "$actionUrl" | jq
```

which in this case fails with a 400 Bad Request error and the following payload:

```json
{
  "id": "f895fafb-bf76-4f13-83a2-241b2dfd09dd",
  "type": "api",
  "expires_at": "2020-08-17T20:58:51.9056258Z",
  "issued_at": "2020-08-17T20:48:51.9056258Z",
  "request_url": "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/api",
  "active": "password",
  "messages": null,
  "methods": {
    "password": {
      "method": "password",
      "config": {
        "action": "http://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/login/methods/password?flow=f895fafb-bf76-4f13-83a2-241b2dfd09dd",
        "method": "POST",
        "fields": [
          {
            "name": "identifier",
            "type": "text",
            "required": true,
            "value": "i-do-not-exist@user.org"
          },
          {
            "name": "password",
            "type": "password",
            "required": true
          },
          {
            "name": "csrf_token",
            "type": "hidden",
            "required": true
          }
        ],
        "messages": [
          {
            "id": 4000006,
            "text": "The provided credentials are invalid, check for spelling mistakes in your password or username, email address, or phone number.",
            "type": "error",
            "context": {}
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "forced": false
}
```

On success, that endpoint would typically return a HTTP 200 Status OK response with the success `application/json` response
paylaod in the body.
