ORY Kratos implements flows that users perform themselves as opposed to
administrative intervention. Facebook and Google both provide self-service
registration and profile management features as you are able to make changes to
your profile and sign up yourself.

Most believe that user management systems are easy to implement because picking
the right password hashing algorithm and sending an account verification code is
a solvable challenge. The real complexity however hides in the details and
attack vectors of self-service flows. Most data leaks happen because someone is
able to exploit

- registration: with attack vectors such as account enumeration (), ...;
- login: phishing, account enumeration, leaked password databases, brute-force,
  ...;
- user settings: account enumeration, account takeover, ...;
- account recovery: social engineering attacks, account takeover, spoofing, and
  so on.

There are also many other areas you need to think about, such as:

- Mobile, Smart TV, ... authentication
- Linking and unlinking social profiles (e.g. "Sign in with Google" or "Connect
  with Google") to existing accounts

ORY Kratos applies best practices established by experts (National Institute of
Sciences NIST, Internet Engineering Task Force IETF, Microsoft Research, Google
Research, Troy Hunt, ...) and implements the following flows:

- [Login and Registration](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration)
- [Logout](self-service/flows/user-logout)
- [User Settings](self-service/flows/user-settings)
- [Account Recovery](self-service/flows/account-recovery)
- [Address Verification](self-service/flows/verify-email-account-activation)
- [User-Facing Error](self-service/flows/user-facing-errors)
- [2FA / MFA](self-service/flows/2fa-mfa-multi-factor-authentication)

Some flows break down into strategies which implement some of the flow's
business logic:

- The `password` strategy implement the
  [login and registration with "email or/and username and password" method](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration/username-email-password),
  account recovery flow ("reset your password"), and
  ["change your password" user settings method](self-service/flows/user-settings/change-password).
- The `oidc` (OpenID Connect, OAuth2, Social Sign In) strategy implements
  ["Sign in with ..." login and registration method](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration/openid-connect-social-sign-in-oauth2),
  and
  ["un/link another social account" user settings method](self-service/flows/user-settings/link-unlink-openid-connect-oauth2).
- The `profile` strategy implements the
  ["update your profile", "change your first/last name, ..." user settings method)](self-service/flows/user-settings/user-profile-management).
- The `link` strategy implements the
  ["click this link to reset your password" account recovery method](self-service/flows/user-settings/user-profile-management).

Some flows additionally implement the ability
[to run hooks](self-service/hooks/index) which allow users to be immediately
signed in after registration, notify another system on successful registration
(e.g. Mailchimp), and so on.

## Performing Login, Registration, Settings, ... Flows

There are two flow types supported in ORY Kratos:

- Flows where the user sits in front of the Browser (e.g. website, single page
  app, ...)
- Flows where API interaction is required (e.g. mobile app, Smart TV, ...)

All Self-Service Flows
([User Login](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration),
[User Registration](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration),
[Profile Management](self-service/flows/user-settings),
[Account Recovery](self-service/flows/account-recovery),
[Email or Phone verification](self-service/flows/verify-email-account-activation))
support these two flow types and work more or less the same.

### Browser Flows

1. The Browser opens (e.g. with `<a>` or `window.location.href`) the flow's
   initialization endpoint (e.g.`/self-service/login/browser` or
   `/self-service/registration/browser`).
2. The initialization endpoint creates a flow object and stores it in the
   database. The flow object has an ID and contains additional information about
   the flow such as the login methods (e.g. "username/password" and "Sign in
   with Google") and their form data. Once stored, the Browser is HTTP 302
   redirected to the flow's configured UI URL (e.g.
   `selfservice.flows.login.ui_url`), appending the flow ID as the `flow` URL
   Query Parameter;
3. The endpoint responsible for the UI URL uses the `flow` URL Query Parameter
   (e.g. `http://my-app/auth/login?flow=abcde`) to call the flow information
   endpoint (e.g. `/self-service/login/flows?id=abcde`) and fetch the flow
   data - so for example the login form and any validation errors. This endpoint
   is available at both ORY Kratos's Public and Admin Endpoints.
4. The UI endpoint renders the fetched data in any way it sees it fit. The flow
   is typically completed by the browser making another request to one of ORY
   Kratos' endpoints, which is usually described in the fetched request data in
   form of an e.g. form action URL.

### API Flows

1. The client makes a `Accept: application/json` GET request to the flow's
   initialization endpoint (e.g.`/self-service/login/api` or
   `/self-service/registration/api`).
2. The initialization endpoint creates a flow object and stores it in the
   database. The flow object has an ID and contains additional information about
   the flow such as the login methods (e.g. "username/password" and "Sign in
   with Google") and their form data. Once stored, the flow data is directly
   returned as `application/json` without redirects.
3. The client uses the flow data to render the UI - so for example the login
   form and any validation errors.
4. The client completes the flow by e.g. making another `application/json`
   request.
5. If needed, the client can re-request the flow information (e.g. because the
   form completed with validation errors) by calling the flow information
   endpoint (e.g. `/self-service/login/flows?id=abcde`). This endpoint is
   available at both ORY Kratos's Public and Admin Endpoints.
